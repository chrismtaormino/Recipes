# Recipes is an App that uses the bazel build tool. For information about how to set up bazel refer to their website:
# https://www.bazel.build/

# If you have bazel already and wish to build the project, refer to the BUILD file for targets.
# A full build at this moment is the "recipes" target.
# `bazel build recipes`

# To clean the project:
# `bazel clean`

# To run the project:
# `bazel run recipes`
# This command can be used to run any recipe specified in the BUILD file with a valid entry point.
